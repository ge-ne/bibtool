.SH NAME
BibTool \- BibTeX file manipulation tool
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B bibtool
[options] [files]
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual is not meant to be exhaustive.
The complete documentation for
.B BibTool
can be found in the
.IR "BibTool Manual" .
BibTeX provides an easy to use means to integrate citations and
bibliographies into LaTeX documents. But the user is left alone with
the management of the BibTeX files.
.B BibTool
is intended to fill this gap.
.B BibTool
allows the  manipulation of BibTeX files which goes
beyond the possibilities - and intentions - of BibTeX.
.PP
.B BibTool
manipulates BibTeX database files through
the command line front\-end
.B bibtool
which accepts numerous options.
Modifications are performed through
resource instructions
that allow the modification of the various internal parameters
determining the behavior of 
.BR BibTool ;
resource instructions can be grouped in resource files.
The original
.B BibTool
distribution contains a sufficient set of resource file samples
to perform basic, relevant manipulations.
